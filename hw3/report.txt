In this weeks assignment we observed the differneces between a look ahead carry adder and a ripple carry adder. 
In the testbench it was clear that when doing some operations, for example: 2 + 11. 
There are points where the output changes to 9 isntead of 13 for a couple of nanoseconds.
We also know that the carry look ahead adder should be noticably faster than the ripple carry adder. 
However, because of how vivado synthesizes the logic it actually ends up giving the same look up table when implementing it.
So when you look at the schematic for both verisions of the adder they look identical.
